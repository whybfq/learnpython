## Say we have a list of strings we want to sort by the last letter of the string.
strs = ['xc', 'zb', 'yd', 'wa']


## Write a little function that takes a string, and returns its last letter.
## This will be the key function (takes in 1 value, returns 1 value).
def MyFn(s):
    return s[-1]


## Now pass key=MyFn to sorted() to sort by the last letter:
print sorted(strs, key=MyFn)  ## ['wa', 'zb', 'xc', 'yd']
