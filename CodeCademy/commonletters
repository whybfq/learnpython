'''
Write a function called common_letters that takes two arguments, string_one and string_two and then returns a list with all of the letters they have in common.

The letters in the returned list should be unique. For example,

common_letters("banana", "cream") should return ['a']

    if (letter in string_two) and not (letter in common):
      common.append(letter)
