'''
One way is by utilizing the range() method, with a negative step value, 
so that the index decreases by 1 per element, essentially going backward 
in the list. The start index must begin at the last index of the list, 
and the end index would have to be offset by 1 to the first index, 
because it is exclusive. This will look something like the following,
'''

for i in range(len(list)-1,-1,-1):
  ...

'''
Another way to iterate over a list backward is to utilize list slicing, 
with a negative step. This will return a new list of elements in reverse order.
'''

for i in list[::-1]:
  ...
